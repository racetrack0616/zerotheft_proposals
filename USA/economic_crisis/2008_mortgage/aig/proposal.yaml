  Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, American International Group Inc. (AIG)
  was the

  major insurance company in the world. However, due to several derivative
  transactions not

  related to its core business, AIG collapsed in September 2008. Before its
  collapse in September 2008, AIG was the largest insurance company in the

  world. By early 2007, its reported consolidated total asset was more than $1
  trillion.

  Let’s learn what CDOs and CDS mainly are?

  CDOs are a type of structured asset-backed security (ABS) whose value and
  payments

  are derived from and collateralized (or “backed”) by a portfolio of
  fixed-income underlying

  assets.

  The investors who buy those securities often manage the risk by acquiring a
  CDS. CDS is an over-the-counter (OTC) off-balance-sheet derivative instrument
  that permits one party (the

  beneficiary) to transfer the credit risk of a reference asset, which it
  typically owns, to another

  party (the guarantor) without actually selling the asset. The beneficiary
  agrees to make payments based on the notional amount (premium) to the
  guarantor, who agrees to pay a certain

  amount of money in the event of default of the reference asset.

  The easy way to understand CDSs ("Credit Default Swaps") is that they are an
  insurance policy, for 

  investors who purchased (own as investors) a block of mortgages (MBSs) and
  this insurance pays them back

  for any DROP in value (aka if house prices go down).

  How AIG led to the financial crisis in 2008? How did this affect the people?
  Did AIG steal money by a rigged economy by selling CDS insurance?
reasoning: >
  1) All financial markets will have UPs and DOWNs. It is a reasonable
  expectation for an expert in insurance
     and financial products to expect that the US housing marketing could go down?
  2) Did AIG sell more CDS insurance on mortgages (directly or indirectly) than
  it could pay off if the entire
     US housing market went down?
  3) Did AIG steal money by selling CDS insurance when it couldn't pay off when
  a decrease
     in housing prices happened or defaults happened?
  4) Did the Federal Reserve pay peak market prices to buy mortgages (MBSs) in
  order to give
     #~~~ answer is yes. See Bernanie Fed Chair book ~~~~~~
     cash to investors so their losses on poor investment choices were paid off.
  5) Why didn't AIG Financial go out of business, without causing harm to the
  main AIG? This is how
     economics are supposed to work
     #~~~ Find other cases where a subsidiary went out of business but the parent company didn't go out of business ~~~~
  6) Are the American citizens stolen from when trillions are printed by the Fed
  of USD and transferred to the wealthy?

  7) Did the Fed print $1 Trillion to $2 Trillion to buy MBSs from AIG and AIG's
  customers (and other CDSs creators)

  8) The TARP get paid back, but American citizens were never paid back for the
  $1T to $2T printed to buy
     ailed (& lower valued) mortgages (MBSs & CDOs) that were purchased at peak (pre-failure) prices?

      A new financial product known as a collateralized debt obligation (CDO)
      became the darling of investment banks and other large institutions. CDOs
      lump various types of debt from the very safe to the very risky into one
      bundle for sale to investors. The various types of debt are known as
      tranches.


      Many large institutions holding mortgage-backed securities created CDOs.
      These included tranches filled with subprime loans. That is, they were
      mortgages issued during the housing bubble to people who were
      ill-qualified to repay them. 


      The AIGFP decided to cash in on the trend. It would insure CDOs against
      default through a financial product known as a credit default swap. The
      chances of having to pay out on this insurance seemed highly unlikely.


      The CDO insurance plan was a big success, for a while. In about five
      years, the division's revenues rose from $737 million to more than $3
      billion, about 17.5% of the company's total.


      A big chunk of the insured CDOs came in the form of bundled mortgages,
      with the lowest-rated tranches comprised of subprime loans. AIG believed
      that defaults on these loans would be insignificant. 


      AIG wasn't in the mindset that housing market would go down.


      Experts in the insurance industry should have known that there won't only
      be the upward trend in the housing market. There might be the downward
      trend too. Housing industry too works as other markets like stock markets
      and so on.

      Lending money for mortgages was once a conservative business. Potential
      homebuyers had to reveal their credit history and make a substantial down
      payment before receiving loans for mortgages.


      The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates. Buyers could more easily
      finance an expensive purchase like a car or even a house. For little or no
      money down, a homebuyer could get an adjustable rate mortgage that might
      require only payment of interest for two years. Sharply rising payments
      followed. But as the flood of new homeowners drove prices up steadily, the
      home buyer could borrow more on it, or even sell for a profit.


      Banks, mortgage broker agencies, and Wall Street investment firms took
      advantage of the boom to sell mortgage-backed securities. These were
      bundles of mortgages they transformed into stock securities and sold to
      individuals and institutions worldwide. The business of lending money to
      people became a reckless, unregulated gold rush. In 2004, for example, the
      Securities and Exchange Commission, whose job is to oversee and regulate
      Wall Street, exempted big investment banks from a debt limit regulation.
      This allowed them to invest billions held in reserve against losses and
      invest the money in mortgage-backed securities and other newly-created,
      complex financial instruments.


      Joe Nocera writes in the New York Times that an AIG unit in London "was
      filled with go-go financial wizards who devised new and clever ways of
      taking advantage of Wall Street's insatiable appetite for mortgage-backed
      securities,"and sold credit-default swaps, a kind of insurance for the
      securities.


      "In effect," writes Nocera, "AIG was saying if, by some remote chance
      (ha!) those mortgage-backed securities suffered losses, the company would
      be on the hook for the losses." But because the company had a AAA credit
      rating, the mortgage-backed securities they insured with credit-default
      swaps got AAA ratings, too.


      "Why would Wall Street and the banks go for this? Because it shifted the
      risk of default from themselves to AIG, and the AAA rating made the
      securities much easier to market." AIG got substantial fees, but it saw
      them "as risk-free money" and "surely would never have to actually pay up.
      Like everyone else on Wall Street, AIG operated on the belief that the
      underlying assets—housing—could only go up in price."


      They were wrong. Unlike other forms of insurance, say for a fire, that
      require the insuring company to set aside enough money if it has to
      compensate an owner for one, AIG didn't have to set aside anything. It
      didn't. Credit-default swaps were not regulated.


      In 2006, new housing construction and prices faltered. By 2007, in an
      overstuffed housing market, both declined. By 2008 it was clear that the
      boom had become a deflating bubble. AIG, or, rather, the American
      taxpayer, was eventually stuck with hundreds of billions in credit default
      swaps.


      The company had also taken on other mysterious risks, like "collateral
      triggers." They guaranteed that "if certain events took place, like a
      ratings downgrade for either AIG or the securities it was insuring, it
      would have to put up collateral against those securities, Again, the
      reason it agreed to the collateral triggers was pure greed, it could get
      higher fees by including them. And again, it assumed that the triggers
      would never actually kick in...Those collateral riggers have since cost
      AIG many, many billions of dollars. Or, rather, they've cost American
      taxpayers billions." (Joe Nocera, "Propping Up A House of Cards," New York
      Times, 2/28/09)


      US government leaders decided that AIG was "too big to fail," that the
      consequences of failure were too damaging to permit.

    description: >
      Most of the post-mortems of AIG focus on its selling of credit default
      swaps, which are financial instruments that act like insurance contracts
      on bonds. In these transactions, the insurance seller (in this case, AIG)
      in some ways becomes the bond owner.


      “Think about home insurance,” McDonald says. “If you’ve sold insurance on
      a house, and the house burns to the ground, you have to pay. The insurance
      seller has the same risk as an uninsured homeowner.” Likewise, if the
      bonds AIG insured did not pay out, the company was on the hook for those
      losses.


      Over the course of these agreements, the value of the underlying asset
      will change, and one party will pay the other money, called collateral,
      based on that change; that collateral can flow back and forth between the
      two parties as the market moves. AIG’s credit default swaps did not call
      for collateral to be paid in full due to market changes. “In most cases,
      the agreement said that the collateral was owed only if market changes
      exceeded a certain value or if AIG’s credit rating fell below a certain
      level,” McDonald says.


      AIG was accruing unpaid debts—collateral it owed its credit default swap
      partners, but did not have to hand over due to the agreements’ collateral
      provisions. But when AIG’s credit rating was lowered, those collateral
      provisions kicked in—and AIG suddenly owed its counterparties a great deal
      of money.


      On September 15, 2008, the day all three major agencies downgraded AIG to
      a credit rating below AA-, calls for collateral on its credit default
      swaps rose to $32 billion and its shortfall hit $12.4 billion—a huge
      change from $8.6 billion in collateral calls and $4.5 billion in shortfall
      just three days earlier. While this debt kicked in automatically because
      of the provisions in AIG’s agreements, rather than the willful
      terminations of its securities lending agreements, “it’s still a little
      like a bank run, in the sense that all of a sudden you’re in trouble, and
      the fact that you’re in trouble means you get a big call on your assets,”
      McDonald says.


      AIG had written credit default swaps on over $500 billion in assets. But
      it was the $78 billion in credit default swaps on multi-sector
      collateralized debt obligations—a security backed by debt payments from
      residential and commercial mortgages, home equity loans, and more—that
      proved most troublesome. AIG’s problems were exacerbated by the fact that
      these were one-way bets. AIG didn’t have any offsetting positions that
      would make money if its swaps in this sector lost money.

      SEC Charges New York-Based Dark Pool Operator With Failing to Safeguard
      Confidential Trading Information

    description: >
      On Tuesday, November 25, 2008 the Federal Reserve surprised almost
      everyone

      when it announced that it would initiate a program to purchase up to $500
      billion in

      mortgage-backed securities (MBS) backed by the housing-related
      government-sponsored

      enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and backed by Ginnie Mae.


      We employ empirical pricing models for mortgage-backed security (MBS)
      yields and for mortgage rates to

      measure deviations from normal market functioning in order to assess how
      the Federal Reserve MBS purchase

      program—a 16 month program announced on November 25, 2008 and completed on
      March 31, 2010—affected

      risk premiums that were embedded in mortgage and swap markets. Our pricing
      models suggest that the

      announcement of the program, which signaled strong and credible government
      backing for mortgage markets in

      particular and for the financial system more generally, reduced mortgage
      rates by about 85 basis points between

      November 25 and December 31, 2008, even though no MBS had (yet) been
      purchased by the Federal Reserve.

      Once the Federal Reserve’s MBS program started purchasing MBS, we estimate
      that the abnormal risk

      premiums embedded mortgage rates decreased roughly 50 basis points.
      However, observed mortgage rates

      declined only slightly because of generally rising interest rates.

      After May 27, 2009 fairly normal pricing conditions existed in U.S.
      primary and secondary mortgage markets;

      that is, the relationship between mortgage rates and its determinants was
      similar to that observed prior to the

      financial crisis. After the end of the Federal Reserve’s MBS purchase
      program on March 31, 2010, mortgage

      rates and interest rates more generally were significantly less than they
      had been at the beginning.

      In sum, we estimate that the Federal Reserve’s MBS purchase program
      removed substantial risk premiums

      embedded in mortgage rates because of the financial crisis. The Federal
      Reserve also re-established a robust

      secondary mortgage market, which meant that the marginal mortgage borrower
      was funded by the capital

      markets and not directly by the banks during the financial crisis—had bank
      funding been the only source of

      funds, primary mortgage rates would have been much higher.

      Lastly, many observers have attributed part of the Federal Reserve’s
      effect from purchasing MBS to portfolio

      rebalancing. We find that if portfolio rebalancing had a substantial
      effect, it may have had its greatest

      importance only after the Federal Reserve’s purchases ended, but while the
      Federal Reserve held a substantial

      portion of the stock of outstanding MBS.

      Allowing AIG to fail would have:

      • Taught a meaningful lesson to other companies.

      • Careful centralized liquidity and risk management is important.

      • Provided regulatory consistency. Lehman was allowed to fail because it
      was insolvent. AIG was insolvent too.

      • Even after AIG’s initial rescue, government could have allowed
      bankruptcy.


      What Does Adding the Securities Lending Piece of the Story Tell Us?

      • Regulation is not the answer. The life insurance companies were heavily
      regulated by the states.

      • There is no basis for assuming that the Fed will do a better job than
      the state insurance regulators did at monitoring risk-taking.

      • AIG is not the poster child for Dodd-Frank derivatives reform that some
      have suggested it is.


      What Should We Do?

      • People care about risks when their money is on the line  We need to look
      for ways to make shareholders and creditors bear losses when things go
      badly.

      • We need to make sure that bailouts are not an option.

      • Make bankruptcy work for large financial companies.


      AIG Bailout, Investment Success?

      • Yes, if simply getting paid back is success. In that case, I’d like to
      borrow $100 from you today. I’ll pay it back in 5 years. No, if we
      consider opportunity cost and risk.

      • Lots of companies were looking for cash in 2008.

      • Private consortium had decided AIG was lousy investment.

      • If gov’t is playing investor, it has to consider riskreward tradeoff. We
      could have earned a better return on a lower-risk investment. Due to
      government aid AIG Financial didn't go out of business.

      On February 28, 2008, American International Group, Inc. (AG), then the
      largest insurance company in the United States, announced 2007 earnings of
      $6.20 billion or $2.39 per share. Its stock closed that day at $50.15 per
      share. Less than seven months later, however, AIG was on the verge of
      bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the United States government through
      an $85 billion loan. Government aid has since grown to $182.5 billion, and

      The stimulus bill passed in February 2009 created an estimated $794.1
      billion in spending programs and tax cuts. However, this understates the
      program’s long-term cost, because some of the stimulus spending increases
      will probably be made permanent. According to the Congressional Budget
      Office, extending 20 popular stimulus bill provisions will bring the
      bill’s 10-year cost, including debt payments, to $3.27 trillion.


      The effect of bailout spending on our national debt is harder to predict.
      Many of the bailouts involve loans and stock purchases. If companies
      regain financial health, stock prices stabilize and loans are paid back,
      the government may recoup a large amount of the bailout money. However, to
      fund the bailout and stimulus, the government has already had to borrow,
      adding to the national debt, increasing the interest payments due.

      The MBS program completed its purchases on March 31, 2010, but will
      continue to settle transactions over the coming months. In connection with
      this activity, the Federal Reserve continues to use dollar roll and coupon
      swap transactions to facilitate an orderly settlement of the program’s
      purchases.


      This agency MBS program is managed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
      at the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The New York
      Fed will continue to work with two investment managers to support the
      implementation of the program.


      The FOMC directed the Desk to purchase $1.25 trillion of agency MBS.
      Actual purchases by the program effectively reached this target. The
      purchase activity began on January 5, 2009 and continued through March 31,
      2010.
